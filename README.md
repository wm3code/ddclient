# ddclient
Dynamic DNS Client
<br><br>
This is a ubuntu base with ddclient installed. A volume is exposed to the /etc directory. All you have to do is edit the ddclient.conf file and restart the container<br>
Once the container restarts your configuration will kick in and update just as DDClient would normally. Please consult your DNS Provider for advising on configuration<br>

I will be making a more indepth documentation record for this repository when I can.
